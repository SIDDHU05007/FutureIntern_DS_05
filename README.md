# Email Spam Filtering Project

## Project Description
This project involves building a machine learning model to automatically detect and filter out spam emails. The model is trained using the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset, focusing on text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm. The goal is to enhance email security by accurately identifying unwanted and potentially harmful messages.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection), containing over 5,000 labeled SMS messages, either as spam or ham (non-spam).

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, tokenization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Model Training**: Using Naive Bayes for spam classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations for insights into message length distribution, word frequency, and label distribution.
